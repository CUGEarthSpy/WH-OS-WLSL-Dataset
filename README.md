# WH-OS-WLSL-Dataset
##Introduction
A multi-labeled scene-level dataset, WH-OS-MLSL, was constructed using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data.The study area was chosen to be Wuhan city (shown in Fig. 1). The optical remote sensing image is the Level-1C level product of Sentinel II, with ortho-corrected and subimage-level geometrically refined corrected remote sensing data, and the image is acquired on March 20, 2020, with 13 bands.The SAR image is selected from the Ground Range Detection (GRD) Level 1 data of Sentinel I, which contains two types of VV and VH polarizations, and the IW operation mode is selected, and the IW operation mode is selected, and the IW operation mode is selected. The acquisition date is March 15, 2020. This dataset contains six categories, namely water bodies, roads, buildings, bare land, green land, and agricultural land, and each pair of optical and SAR scene images is assigned one or more category labels.

##Details
This dataset contains six categories, namely, water bodies, roads, buildings, bare land, green land, and farmland, and each pair of optical and SAR scene images is assigned one or more category labels.The WH-OS-MLSL dataset contains 4,101 sheets in the water body category, 1,415 sheets in the road category, 3,658 sheets in the building category, 1,703 sheets in the bare land category, 11,477 sheets in the green land category, and 4,164 sheets in the farmland category. category 4164 sheets. The largest percentage of greenfield is 43.3% and the smallest percentage of roads is 5.3%. The number of labels in each image is not consistent due to different categories in different scene images. There are 13,479 images with 1 label, 5,267 images with 2 labels, 719 images with 3 labels, and 87 images with 4 labels .
