# WH-OS-WLSL-Dataset
#A multi-labeled scene-level dataset, WH-OS-MLSL, was constructed using Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral remote sensing data.The study area was chosen to be Wuhan city (shown in Fig. 1). The optical remote sensing image is the Level-1C level product of Sentinel II, with ortho-corrected and subimage-level geometrically refined corrected remote sensing data, and the image is acquired on March 20, 2020, with 13 bands.The SAR image is selected from the Ground Range Detection (GRD) Level 1 data of Sentinel I, which contains two types of VV and VH polarizations, and the IW operation mode is selected, and the IW operation mode is selected, and the IW operation mode is selected. The acquisition date is March 15, 2020.
